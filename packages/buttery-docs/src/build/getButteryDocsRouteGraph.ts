/**
 * Takes the route manifest and recursively turns it into a graphical
 * representation of the routes. For instance if the route path is
 * /commands/getting-started/reference, this function will split the path
 * and create a nested graph of those segments such as `commands.pages.getting-started.pages.reference`.
 *
 * This function is created to automatically adapt to any additions to the route manifest. There is
 * no code in this function that will add any properties or delete any. Instead it's only
 * purpose is to read the route segments and create a nested graph of them. This
 * is done intentionally so that the route manifest is the central brain to a lot of the data
 * that is needed to make routing and the things around them as clean as possible as well
 * as provide the ability to scale the manifest as needed.
