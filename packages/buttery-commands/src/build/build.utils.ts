 * We dynamically create our entry points up to 20 glob paths

 * command files then I feel like there are more serious problems
 * than being able to load them... :/
 *
 * The reason we try to evaluate on globs is that if we find that
 * a file is invalid or we want to add another file after the load
 * process starts, we can do that, esbuild will handle it, and then
 * we can create the manifest after we know all of the commands
 * are well formed
